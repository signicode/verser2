## Responsibility

TLS HTTP/2 server implementation of the Verser Host — accepts outbound connections from Guest and Broker peers, attaches optional in-process local Guests and Brokers, manages peer registration, maintains Guest lease pools, routes Broker requests to target Guests via lease streams or local dispatch, and advertises route changes to connected Brokers.

## Design / Patterns

- **Node `http2.createSecureServer`** — the Host is a secure HTTP/2 server only. No HTTP/1, no plaintext, no HTTP/3. Connections are outbound-initiated (peers connect *to* the Host).
- **Protocol paths** — `/verser/register` (registration), `/verser/guest/control` (Guest coordination), `/verser/guest/lease` (Guest request/response body streams), `/verser/request` (Broker request dispatch), `/verser/host/federation` (Host-to-Host handshake), `/verser/host/federation/routes` (federated route stream), `/verser/host/federation/request` (idle federated request stream), and `/verser/host/federation/dispatch-request` (one-shot federated dispatch stream). Any other path is rejected.
- **Lease stream pool** — each Guest establishes one or more lease streams. The Host acquires an idle lease for each incoming Broker request. If none is available, the request is queued with a configurable timeout. Lease acquisition uses `parseLeaseAcquireTimeoutMs` (default 5000 ms).
- **Peer session tracking** — `Map<peerId, RegisteredPeer>` tracks all connected peers. Duplicate peer IDs rejected at registration. Sessions tracked in a `Set` for lifecycle cleanup on disconnect.
- **Local Host peers** — `attachLocalGuest()` and `attachLocalBroker()` register colocated in-process peers into the same Host peer/route tables as TLS HTTP/2 peers. Local Brokers receive the same full route-table replacement semantics and route through the Host target checks.
- **Route advertisement via NDJSON** — when a Guest registers or disconnects, `advertiseRoutes()` sends a `{ type: 'routes', routes: [...] }` NDJSON frame to all Broker control streams. Brokers replace their entire route table on each frame.
- **Registration authorization** — optional `tls.clientAuth.authorizeRegistration` callback receives `VerserRegistrationAuthorizationContext` (peer certificate identity, registration details, TLS auth state). Returning `{ action: 'close' }` rejects with 403 and closes the session.
- **TLS certificate reload** — `reloadTlsCertificate()` calls `server.setSecureContext()` for in-place certificate rotation without dropping existing connections.
- **Lifecycle event emitter** — `onLifecycle()` returns an unsubscribe function. Events: `connected`, `disconnected`, `registered`, `route-advertised`, `request-started`, `request-completed`, `error`, `closed`.

## Data & Control Flow

1. **Connection**: Peer opens TLS HTTP/2 session → `session` event → tracked in `sessions` Set → `connected` lifecycle event emitted.
2. **Registration**: Peer sends JSON body on `/verser/register` → `parseRegistrationRequest()` validates → `authorizeRegistration()` runs optional mTLS callback → `RegisteredPeer` stored in `peers` map → Guest routes stored in `guestRegistrations` → `advertiseRoutes()` notifies all Brokers → `200` response sent.
3. **Local peer attach**: Application calls `attachLocalGuest()` or `attachLocalBroker()` → duplicate IDs and registration authorization are checked → local peer state is stored in `peers` → Guest routes are advertised to local and remote Brokers.
4. **Guest lease attach**: Guest opens stream on `/verser/guest/lease` with `x-verser-peer-id` + `x-verser-lease-id` headers → `attachGuestLeaseStream()` responds `200` → lease added to `idleLeases` pool → if a Broker request is queued for this Guest, the lease is immediately assigned.
5. **Broker request dispatch**: Broker opens stream on `/verser/request` or local Broker calls `request()` → Host target checks run → local Guests are dispatched through minimal Node HTTP shims; H2 Guests use lease streams → response status, headers, and body stream back to the Broker.
6. **Disconnect cleanup**: Session `close` or local handle `close()` → peer removed from `peers`, Guest routes removed, local waiters/active requests/leases failed, route retraction advertised when a Guest disconnected → `disconnected` event emitted.
7. **Host shutdown**: `close(reason)` → closes all control streams, closes all lease streams, rejects local route waiters, aborts active local requests, fails all queued acquisitions, closes all sessions, closes server socket → `closed` event emitted.

## Integration Points

- **Depends on**: `@signicode/verser-common` (envelope encoding, registration parsing, TLS normalization, lifecycle events, header validation, stream reading, route control frames, error types). No external npm dependencies.
- **Consumed by**: Applications that create a Host via `createVerserHost(options)`. The `VerserHost` interface is the public API surface.
- **Internal modules**: `node-http2-verser-host.ts` (orchestration), `lease-pool.ts` (Guest lease stream pool management), `degraded-route-cleanup.ts` (degraded route expiration timer), `broker-routing.ts` (Broker request dispatch, lease routing, federated fallback), `federation.ts` (federation handshake, route frames, lifecycle forwarding, upstream/inbound stream helpers), `local-peers.ts` (local Guest/Broker route, stream, request, and waiter helpers), `http2-io.ts` (stream write helpers), `types.ts` (options + interface types), `utils.ts` (error wrapping), `constants.ts` (package name).
- **Not provided**: Authentication, authorization, rate limiting, logging, metrics, WebSocket/upgrade/tunneling support. Applications integrate those layers themselves.
